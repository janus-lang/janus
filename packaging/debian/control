Description: Systems language with precise incremental compilation
 Janus is a revolutionary systems programming language that features:
 .
  * Precise incremental compilation with mathematical guarantees
  * Progressive complexity profiles (min/go/full)
  * Content-addressed storage (CAS) for deterministic builds
  * ASTDB architecture for advanced tooling capabilities
  * Capability-based security system
  * Zero-cost abstractions with honest performance characteristics
 .
 The language is designed to solve the adoption paradox in systems programming
 by providing familiar patterns that progressively unlock advanced features
 without breaking changes.
