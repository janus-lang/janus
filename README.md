# JANUS

> "System programming has lost its way. We are returning it to the Forge."

**Version:** 0.2.0-2 (Alpha)
**Status:** Alpha Release
**License:** [SSS-1.0](LICENSE) (Self Sovereign Society License)

## ⚒️ The Forge

Janus is not a toy. It is a weapon against software decay.

We built Janus because we were tired of choosing between the safety of a straitjacket and the freedom of a foot-gun. We wanted:
*   **Scientific Rigor** without the bureaucratic overhead.
*   **System Control** without the memory leaks.
*   **Artificial Intelligence** that isn't just a wrapper around a Python API.

Janus is a **Sovereign Systems Language**. It compiles to native machine code via LLVM, runs JIT for rapid prototyping, and enforces deterministic resource management.

## ⚡ v0.2.0 Capabilities

This release marks the point of no return. We are Turing Complete, we are loud, and we are precise.

*   **Sovereign Numerics**: `f64` precision and `VectorF64` dynamic handles. Math that doesn't apologize.
*   **Deterministic Safety**: `defer` cleanups. We don't garbage collect; we take out the trash ourselves.
*   **Dual-State Existence**:
    *   `janus run`: Immediate JIT execution (Interpreter).
    *   `janus build`: Optimized LLVM Native Compilation (AOT).
    *   **Parity**: The code behaves the same in the Bazaar as it does in the Cathedral.
*   **String Handles**: Proper heap-managed strings. No more `char*` soup.

## 🚀 Quick Start

You are an engineer. You know what to do.

```bash
# Build the compiler
make build

# Run the victory script
./zig-out/bin/janus run examples/string_victory_typed.jan
```

*Output:*
```
=== String Victory ===
Output:

## 📚 Documentation

The repository is organized into **Four Pillars**:

1.  **[User Manual](docs/INDEX.md)**: Guides, Operations, and Legal Policy. Start here.
2.  **[Specifications](specs/api-reference.md)**: Technical details for Compiler Developers.
3.  **[Doctrines](doctrines/manifesto.md)**: The Philosophy and Law of Janus.
4.  **[University](docs/teaching/README.md)**: Education, Labs, and Courseware.

### Profiles
Janus adapts to you. See **[User Profiles](docs/profiles.md)**:
*   **The Astronomer**: Scientific precision.
*   **The Engineer**: Systems architecture.
*   **The Hacker**: Minimalist sovereignty.

### AI Policy
Janus enforces **cryptographic governance** for AI contributions via the [**AI-Airlock Protocol**](docs/doctrines/AIRLOCK.md). This is not a policy—it is a **physically enforced mechanism**. AI agents operate in isolated feature branches and require human GPG-signed review to merge.

🤖 **AI Agents**: See [docs/meta/AGENTS.md](docs/meta/AGENTS.md) for the complete development guide and governance rules.
