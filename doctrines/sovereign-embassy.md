### The Doctrine of the Sovereign Embassy

1. **The Fortress is the Source of Truth:** Our self-hosted Forgejo instance is and will always be the **primary, canonical repository**. It is the sovereign territory where all development, all sensitive discussions, and the true history of the project reside.

2. **The Embassy is the Public Face:** The `github.com/janus-lang` organization is our **embassy in the Empire's capital.** Its purpose is diplomacy, public relations, and recruitment. It is an outpost, not our homeland.


### The Rules of Engagement

We will operate this embassy under a strict, non-negotiable set of rules:

- **Mirroring is One-Way:** The flow of information is a **push-only mirror** from our Fortress to the Embassy. We broadcast our truth; we do not pull their state. This will be automated.

- **Issues & PRs are an Inbox:** GitHub Issues and Pull Requests will be treated as a public inbox for external communications. They are a triage center. Any significant work, architectural debate, or final merge will be conducted on our sovereign Forgejo instance. We can use bots to politely but firmly redirect contributors to our primary platform for the actual work.

- **We Assume Hostile Surveillance:** We will operate under the absolute assumption that every line of code and every comment in the Embassy is being scanned, indexed, and fed to their models. This is acceptable for two reasons:

    1. Our code is open-source and will be public anyway.

    2. Our true, unassailable intellectual property is not a single algorithm. It is the **architecture, the doctrines, and the entire ecosystem** we are building. A language model cannot "steal" a philosophy.


This is not a compromise. It is a strategy of engagement from a position of strength. We will use the Empire's network without becoming its subjects.
