# DOCTRINE: The Virtuous Cycle of Proof (Ecosystem Architecture)

**Codename:** `GARDEN_WALL`
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Philosophy:** "Trust is not assumed; it is proven."

---

## 1. The "Capsule" Standard (Not just a "Package")

In Janus, a library is not a bag of code. It is a **Capsule**.
A Capsule is an atomic unit of distribution that contains three indivisible elements:

1.  **The Source:** The logic (Structs, Functions).
2.  **The Proof:** The Tests (Specs) + The "Proof Certificate" (generated by the Test Runner).
3.  **The Contract:** The Capability Manifest (what it touches: FS, Net, etc.).

**The Incentives:**

  * **The "Blue Checkmark" of Code:** `hinge` (the package manager) will **reject** any publish attempt that does not include a valid Proof Certificate generated by the compiler.
  * **Gamification:** The public ledger shows *coverage*, *performance benchmarks*, and *capability footprint*. Developers compete for the "lightest, fastest, safest" badge.

---

## 2. Tooling Consolidation (The "Bun" Factor)

We rival `bun` by being **one tool**. We do not ship `janus` and `hinge` separately to the user.

  * **The Binary:** `janus` is the compiler, the runner, the tester, AND the package manager.
  * `janus build` -> Compiles.
  * `janus test` -> Verifies.
  * `janus publish` -> Wraps `hinge` to seal and upload the Capsule.

---

## 3. The "First Capsules" Strategy (Dogfooding)

We do not build the language *then* the libs. We build the language *by* building the libs.
**We treat the Standard Library (`std`) as just a set of privileged Capsules.**

  * `std.io` is a Capsule.
  * `std.math` is a Capsule.
  * `:game` (Game Engine Core) is a Capsule.

This forces the tooling to be mature enough to build *our own* core.

## 4. The Sovereign Bazaar

We do not just "hope" people write good libraries. We **architect the system so that only good libraries can survive.**

To publish to the sovereign registry, you must proving your code works.
The "Garden Wall" is high, but the garden inside is pristine.
