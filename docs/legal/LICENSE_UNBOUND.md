### 🛡️ Why LUL-1.0?

- **Zero Friction:** Designed for protocols, specifications, and rapid adoption. We want this technology everywhere, even in the hands of competitors.
    
- **Patent Disarmament:** Even though it is permissive, you are still protected by our "Cold War" patent grant.
    
- **Fortified:** Governed by **Dutch Law** (Amsterdam). Simple, but legally bulletproof.
