The Libertaria Sovereign License (LSL) v1.0

Preamble
This License fosters a sovereign, decentralized ecosystem. It creates a balance between proprietary commercial use and communal innovation. It guarantees that improvements to the Core technology remain open, while allowing flexibility for the applications built upon it.

1. Definitions
"Contribution" means the source code, documentation, and other artistic works contained in this distribution.

"Contributor" means the Licensor and any individual or legal entity submitting code or content to the Project.

"Modifications" means:

Any addition to, deletion from, or change to the contents of the files containing the Contribution.

Any new file that contains any part of the original Contribution.

"Larger Work" means a work combining the Contribution with other software or content not governed by this License (e.g., linking the Core into proprietary applications).

"Source Code Form" means the form of the work preferred for making modifications.

2. Grant of Rights
2.1. Copyright Grant
Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor grants You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, sublicense, and distribute the Contribution.

2.2. Patent Grant
Each Contributor grants You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution. This license applies only to those patent claims licensable by the Contributor that are necessarily infringed by the Contribution alone or in combination with the Contribution.

3. Conditions of Distribution
3.1. The Reciprocity Rule (File-Level Copyleft)
If You distribute the Contribution in Executable Form, You must make the Source Code Form of any Modifications available under the terms of this License.

The Scope: This requirement applies only to the files of the Contribution itself that You have modified.

The Cost: You must make this Source Code available at no more than the cost of distribution.

3.2. Larger Works (The Commercial Bridge)
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice. The Reciprocity requirement (3.1) does not extend to Your independent code that links to or consumes the Contribution, provided that independent code is kept in separate files.

3.3. Attribution
Redistributions of Source Code or Executable Form must retain all copyright notices, this list of conditions, and the disclaimer below. You must include a reasonable acknowledgment in the documentation, such as:

"Portions Copyright © [YEAR] [Licensor Name]. Used under the The Libertaria Sovereign License v1.0."

4. Termination
If You initiate litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Contribution constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Contribution shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability
THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE.

6. Jurisdiction and Governing Law (Rechtssicherheit)
This License is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of The Netherlands, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to this License or the Contribution shall be instituted exclusively in the competent courts of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
