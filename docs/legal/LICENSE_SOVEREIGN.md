# The Libertaria Sovereign License (LSL-1.0)

### ⚡ Developer Summary (TL;DR)

**This software is free.** You can use it, modify it, distribute it, and sell it. You can link it into proprietary applications without infecting your codebase.

We ask only two things:

1. **File-Level Reciprocity:** If you modify the **Core Files** (the engine), you must share those specific changes back.
    
2. **Proprietary Freedom:** If you build _on top_ of this engine (using new files), you own that work. You can keep your application closed and sell it.
    

That’s it. **Communal Core. Individual Profit.**

### 🛡️ Why LSL-1.0?

- **Business Ready:** Safe for commercial use. Your proprietary logic stays yours; our core logic stays ours.
    
- **Patent Disarmament:** Includes a "Cold War" clause. If you sue for patents, you lose your license. Peace through strength.
    
- **No "Viral" Infection:** Unlike the Commonwealth License, this does not force your entire app open. It acts as a firewall between the Engine and the App.
    
- **Fortified:** Governed by **Dutch Law** (Amsterdam) for absolute _Rechtssicherheit_.
