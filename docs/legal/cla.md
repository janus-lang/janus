# The Janus Contributor's Oath (CLA v1.0)

_This document is legally based on the Apache Software Foundation Individual CLA v2.2 to ensure it is robust and enforceable._

### The Philosophy

Janus is a free and open commons, forged by a community of disciplined architects. To protect the integrity and future of this project, we require every contributor to grant a clear license for their contributions. This ensures that the codebase remains a single, coherent, and legally unencumbered entity that can be shared with the world. This is not about ownership; it is about shared stewardship.

### The Pact

By commenting the following phrase on a Pull Request, you (“The Contributor”) are signing this oath and agreeing to its terms for all past, present, and future Contributions to the Janus Project.

> **"I have read the Doctrines in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and I hereby swear the Contributor's Oath."**

---
## 1. Definitions

-   **"You" / "The Contributor"**: The individual or legal entity making the Contribution and signing this Oath.
-   **"The Project"**: The collection of open-source software projects managed by the Janus Core team.
-   **"Contribution"**: Any original work of authorship—including source code, documentation, and designs—that You intentionally submit to the Project.

## 2. Your Oath of Contribution (The Grant)

You grant to the Janus Project and all who receive software from it an absolute, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, and irrevocable license for both copyright and patents.

This means you give the Project the right to:
-   Use, reproduce, and distribute Your Contributions.
-   Create and distribute derivative works based on Your Contributions.
-   Sublicense these rights to others.

This grant ensures that Your Contribution becomes a permanent and inseparable part of the Janus commons, free for all to use, modify, and build upon under the terms of the Project's open-source license.

**Defensive Termination:** If you or your legal entity initiates patent litigation against the Project or any of its contributors or users over a Contribution, any and all patent licenses granted to you under this Oath shall immediately terminate.

## 3. Your Pledge (Warranties)

You pledge that:
1.  You have the legal right to grant the license described above.
2.  Each of Your Contributions is your own original work.
3.  Your Contributions are provided **"AS IS,"** without any warranties. You are providing the work in good faith, but you are not liable for its use.
4.  You will notify the Project if any part of this pledge becomes inaccurate.

## 4. The Law of the Forge (Governing Law)

This Oath is governed by the laws of Germany.
