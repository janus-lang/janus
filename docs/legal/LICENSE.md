# The Self Sovereign Society Foundation License (LSL-1.0)

### ⚡ Developer Summary (TL;DR)
**This software is free.** You can use it, modify it, distribute it, and sell it. You can link it into proprietary applications without infecting your codebase.

We ask only two things:

1. **Reciprocity:** If you modify the **Core Files**, share those specific changes back under LSL-1.0—so the ecosystem grows.
2. **Credit:** Keep our copyright notices. You may (and are encouraged to) add your own copyright notices to your modifications. Do not use the Foundation's name to endorse your fork without permission.

That’s it. Own your changes. Code with sovereignty.

### 🛡️ Why LSL-1.0?
* **Patent Safety:** Includes a "Cold War" clause. If you sue for patents, you lose your license. Peace through strength.
* **File-Level Consistency:** Unlike viral licenses (GPL), this only affects the specific Core files you change. Safe for commercial linking; your additions remain yours.
* **Stewardship & Continuity:** This license fosters a thriving ecosystem while guaranteeing Foundation stewardship—ensuring long-term continuity and sovereign public infrastructure for all participants.
