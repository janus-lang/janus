# Module 2: The Spark (What is Programming?)

> "Code is not magic. It is solidified thought."

## The Great Lie
Movies tell you programming is hacking into mainframes with scrolling green text.
Bootcamps tell you programming is memorizing library functions.
Both are wrong.

## The Truth
Programming is **Instruction**.

Imagine a rock. A silicon rock. It cannot think. It cannot feel. It can only do **one thing**:
*   Flip a switch on (1).
*   Flip a switch off (0).

Programming is the art of arranging those switches to simulate intelligence.

### The Feedback Loop
1.  **Thought**: You have an idea ("I want to calculate the Fibonacci sequence").
2.  **Translation**: You translate that idea into a strict logical language (Janus).
3.  **Compilation**: The Compiler (The Forge) beats that language into machine code (Os & 1s).
4.  **Execution**: The Rock obeys.

## The Aha! Moment
When you write:
```janus
print("Hello, Sovereignty.")
```

You are not casting a spell. You are:
1.  Allocating memory for those bytes.
2.  Telling the CPU to point to that memory.
3.  Commanding the Graphics Card to paint pixels on your screen that look like letters.

**You are the Puppeteer. The machine is the Puppet.**

When you realize that *nothing happens without your command*, the fear vanishes. The error messages are not punishments; they are reports from the front lines.

**Let us begin.**
