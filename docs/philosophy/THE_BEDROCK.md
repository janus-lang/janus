# THE JANUS BEDROCK (DOCTRINE)

> "We are not keeping the ashes; we are carrying the fire."

This document distills the wisdom of the Elders into the foundational principles of Janus. It defines what we steal, what we reject, and what we forge anew.

## 1. Utility First (The Python Lesson)
**The Strength:** Ubiquity via Utility. "Batteries Included."
**The Janus Graft:** The Standard Library must be rich. A SysAdmin language cannot require `npm install` to parse JSON or make an HTTP request.
**The Doctrine:** **If it takes 20 lines to read a file, we failed.**

## 2. Secure by Design (The OpenBSD Lesson)
**The Strength:** Uncompromising Correctness. "Secure by Default."
**The Janus Graft:** Variables are immutable by default. Functions are private by default. Documentation is mandatory.
**The Doctrine:** **Code is Law. Defaults matter.**

## 3. Pragmatic Integration (The DragonFly BSD Lesson)
**The Strength:** Fearless Refactoring & Hybridization.
**The Janus Graft:** We do not fight the OS. We wrap `libc` (via Zig) and support C ABI perfectly. We adopt "Hammer" principles for build systems (deduplication/snapshots).
**The Doctrine:** **Don't reinvent the wheel, just the axle.**

## 4. No Hidden Costs (The Zig/C++ Lesson)
**The Strength:** Honesty and Power.
**The Janus Graft:** Memory allocation is explicit (`alloc` arguments). Control flow is visible (no hidden macros). `defer` replaces complex destructors.
**The Doctrine:** **You don't pay for what you don't use. You know what you pay for.**

## 5. Community of Builders
**The Strength:** Value builders over talkers.
**The Janus Graft:** We explicitly reject the "Evangelism Strike Force" model. The tool speaks for itself.
**The Doctrine:** **Code talks. Ideology walks.**
