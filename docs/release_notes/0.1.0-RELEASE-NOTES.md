# Janus v0.1.0-alpha: The Sovereign MVP

**Date:** 2025-12-12  
**Codename:** The First Breath  
**Status:** Alpha Release

> "We do not rewrite the world; we wrap it, strangle it, and replace it." — *The Janus Constitution*

---

## 🏛️ Executive Summary

Janus v0.1.0-alpha is the first **Sovereign Release**. It proves that a systems language can be built on the doctrines of **Syntactic Honesty** and **Graph Sovereignty**.

This release transitions Janus from a theoretical prototype to a functioning compiler capable of producing standalone, native executables.

---

## 🚀 Key Capabilities Delivered

### 1. The Sovereign Graph
Memory ownership within the compiler is strictly enforced. The ASTDB and QTJIR Graph manage their own heap allocations. No dangling pointers. No "borrowing" lies.

**Doctrine Established**: `/docs/doctrines/sovereign-graph-ownership.md`

### 2. Explicit Memory Doctrine
The `:core` profile successfully enforces explicit `Allocator` passing. Hidden `malloc` calls have been purged from the user-facing API.

### 3. Control Flow Nervous System
Recursion, `if/else`, and `return` logic are fully operational end-to-end.

**Verified By**: `tests/integration/recursion_test.zig` (factorial(5) = 120 ✅)

### 4. The First Binary
`janus build hello.jan` successfully emits a linked, executable binary that runs on the host OS.

**Verified By**: `tests/e2e/build_hello.sh` (E2E test passes ✅)

## 📦 What's Included

### Compiler Pipeline
- ✅ **Parser**: Janus source → ASTDB
- ✅ **Lowering**: ASTDB → QTJIR (Quantum-Tensor Janus IR)
- ✅ **Emission**: QTJIR → LLVM IR
- ✅ **Compilation**: LLVM IR → Native Object
- ✅ **Linking**: Object + Runtime → Executable

### Language Features (`:core` Profile)
- ✅ Functions with parameters and return values
- ✅ Control flow (`if`, recursion)
- ✅ Variables (`let` bindings - immutable)
- ✅ Expressions (binary ops: +, -, *, /, <, >, ==)
- ✅ Function calls (direct, recursive, intrinsics)
- ✅ Literals (integers, strings)

### Runtime (`janus_rt`)
- ✅ I/O: `print()`, `println()`, `print_int()`
- ✅ Allocator interface (VTable-based abstraction)
- ✅ Panic handling: `janus_panic()`
- ✅ String operations: `janus_string_len()`, `janus_string_concat()`

### Developer Experience
- ✅ CLI tool: `janus build <source.jan>`
- ✅ Embedded runtime (no external dependencies)
- ✅ E2E testing infrastructure
- ✅ Clear error messages

## ⚠️ Known Issues (Technical Debt)

### Catalogued for v0.2.0

1. **String Byte Alignment**
   - Minor debug warnings regarding string length calculations (23 vs 22 bytes) in `lowerStringLiteral`
   - **Impact**: None - does not affect runtime behavior
   - **Root Cause**: Quote removal edge case in string literal processing

2. **Runtime Dependency**
   - Current `janus_rt` relies on thin C shim (`janus_rt.c`) linking to `libc`
   - **Planned Fix**: Phase 2 will replace with direct Zig/Assembly syscalls
   - **Goal**: Zero external dependencies (true sovereignty)

3. **Profile Limitations**
   - `while` loop implemented but blocked in `:core` profile
   - **Rationale**: Enforces functional purity (use recursion instead)
   - **Status**: Feature, not bug (`:core` is the "Monastery")

4. **Integration Test Updates**
   - Some older tests need updates for multi-function API
   - **Core Functionality**: Unaffected (E2E test passes)

---

## 🔮 Roadmap to v0.2.0

### Epic: The Purge
Replace `janus_rt.c` with pure Zig runtime using direct syscalls.

### Epic: The Bazaar
Implement `:script` profile with JIT compilation for rapid experimentation.

### Epic: Profile Migration
`janus migrate` command to upgrade code between profiles.

### Epic: Type System Evolution
- Type inference
- Algebraic data types (sum types, product types)
- Pattern matching

## 📐 Architectural Foundations

### Doctrines Established

1. **Syntactic Honesty**  
   Syntax reveals cost. No hidden allocations, no invisible control flow.

2. **Revealed Complexity**  
   Complexity is exposed, documented, and justified - never hidden.

3. **The Sovereign Graph**  
   Memory ownership is explicit. The graph owns its data. No borrowing, no exceptions.

4. **Profile Discipline**  
   Power is earned through discipline. `:core` enforces purity before granting `:sovereign` capabilities.

## 🧪 Verification

### Tests Passing
- ✅ **Recursion Test**: Factorial calculation (native stack)
- ✅ **E2E Test**: Full compilation pipeline
- ✅ **Control Flow**: Conditionals and branches
- ✅ **Memory**: Clean allocation/deallocation

### Tests with Known Issues
- ⚠️ Some integration tests need API updates (non-blocking)

## 💡 Philosophy

Janus v0.1.0-alpha embodies the principle of **Functional Honesty**:

- The system does **exactly** what it claims
- Known limitations are **documented**, not hidden  
- The `:core` profile is **intentionally restrictive**
- Every design decision is **justified** by doctrine

**"Stable" does not mean "Finished." It means "Functionally Honest."**

## 🔥 Closing Statement

On this date, Janus produced its **first sovereign binary** — a native executable compiled entirely from Janus source code, through the full pipeline, without compromise.

This is not a prototype. This is not a proof-of-concept.

**This is a working systems language compiler.**

The theoretical has become tangible.  
The vision has become executable.  
The doctrine has become **demonstrated truth**.

**The Promethean Fire burns steady.**

**Version**: 0.1.0-alpha  
**Stability**: Experimental  
**Recommendation**: Ship it. 🚀
