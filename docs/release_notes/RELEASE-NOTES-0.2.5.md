# Janus 0.2.5: The Constitutional Ratification

**Release Date**: 2026-01-09
**Codename**: "The Constitutional Stack"
**Status**: Normative Standard / Ratified

---

## 📜 The Ratification

For a language to survive, it must be governed by **Law**, not just implementation.
Release 0.2.5 marks the **Ratification** of the Janus Specification Suite. We have moved from "Draft" descriptions to **Normative Standards** enforced by RFC 2119 language ("MUST", "SHALL").

We have established the **Constitutional Stack** (Tier 0 to Tier 6), ensuring that Semantics (Tier 1) always outrank Syntax (Tier 6).

## 🏛️ The Constitutional Stack

We have structured the specifications into a hierarchy of authority:

### Tier 0: Constitutional Law (The Meta)
- **SPEC-000**: Meta-Specification (The Rule of Law)

### Tier 1: Semantic Reality (The Truth)
- **SPEC-001**: Core Semantics (Evaluation Model)
- **SPEC-002**: Profile System (Controlled Complexity)
- **SPEC-003**: Runtime System (Observable Reality)

### Tier 2: Failure & Boundaries
- **SPEC-011**: Panic Taxonomy (Failure Modes)
- **SPEC-012**: Boot & Capabilities (Ambient Authority Forbidden)

### Tier 3: Meaning Before Shape (The Lock)
- **SPEC-006**: Sema Architecture (Type Judgments)
- **SPEC-014**: Pattern Matching (Structural Analysis)
- **SPEC-015**: Ownership & Affinity (The Covenant) - *New!*

### Tier 4-6: Representation & Surface
- **SPEC-007**: ASTDB Schema (The Graph)
- **SPEC-004**: Tokenizer (Lexical Truth)
- **SPEC-005**: Surface Grammar (Non-Authoritative)

## ✨ Key Deliverables

### 1. SPEC-015: Ownership & Affinity (The Semantic Lock)
We have drafted the "Covenant" of Janus memory management.
- **Three Laws of Ownership**: Single Owner, Move Semantics, Affine Destruction.
- **Ghost Memory**: Flow-sensitive analysis without garbage collection.
- **Lifetimes**: Explicit `'a` syntax and elision rules.

### 2. Normative Cleanup
- All core specs updated to use `[ID:X.X]` paragraph indexing for traceability.
- unambiguous RFC 2119 terminology.
- `legacy/` directory established for pre-ratification documents.

### 3. Versioning
- Patched version to **2026.1.10** to reflect the new documentation baseline.
- "The Forge Cycle" now mandates documentation updates with every feature.

## 🧭 The Path to 0.3.0

With the specifications ratified, we are now ready to implement the **Semantic Lock** (v0.3.0). The compiler will be refactored to enforce the rules laid out in SPEC-015 and SPEC-006.

**The Law is written. Now we build the Enforcer.**
