ERROR S1101: Ambiguous dispatch for call to 'make_sound'
  at ambiguous_dispatch_error.jan:42:12

  with argument types: (Platypus)

  Conflicting implementations:
    make_sound(Platypus) -> string at ambiguous_dispatch_error.jan:21:5
      Accessible via: Platypus -> Mammal -> Animal
      Specificity: Platypus implements Mammal, Mammal extends Animal

    make_sound(Platypus) -> string at ambiguous_dispatch_error.jan:21:5
      Accessible via: Platypus -> Bird -> Animal
      Specificity: Platypus implements Bird, Bird extends Animal

  Resolution paths have equal specificity:
    Path 1: Platypus -> Mammal -> Animal (distance: 2)
    Path 2: Platypus -> Bird -> Animal (distance: 2)

  Suggestion: Disambiguate the call using explicit interface qualification:
    - Use 'creature as Mammal' to select the Mammal path
    - Use 'creature as Bird' to select the Bird path
    - Or add a more specific implementation that resolves the ambiguity

  Note: This ambiguity exists because Platypus implements both Mammal and Bird,
        and both interfaces extend Animal with the same method signature.
        The compiler cannot determine which implementation path to prefer.
