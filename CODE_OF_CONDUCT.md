# PROTOCOLS OF ENGAGEMENT

**Version:** 1.1 (Updated with Sovereign Ecosystem Doctrine) **Status:** Enforced

## 1\. THE PRIME DIRECTIVE: PROVABLE CORRECTNESS

This project is an engineering meritocracy. Our primary objective is the creation of secure, privacy-first, and technically correct code. We reject "Open Source but not Open Contribution" stagnation; we demand a diverse set of contributors to harden the core against entropy.

- **Code is Liability:** Do not commit code that you have not ruthlessly vetted.
    
- **Simulation over Assumption:** Unit tests are insufficient. We prioritize **Deterministic Simulation Testing** (fuzzing, fault injection, time virtualization). If your code cannot survive a simulated hostile environment, it does not exist.
    
- **Security is not a Feature:** It is the baseline. "Move fast and break things" is rejected here. We move deliberately and secure things.
    
- **Merit Wins:** The quality of the patch determines its acceptance. Seniority, reputation, or identity are irrelevant variables in the equation of code quality.
    

## 2\. APOLITICAL ENGINEERING

We are builders, not activists. This repository is a workspace, not a stage for beliefs.

- **Radical Indifference:** We do not care if you have blue hair, a grey beard, or no hair at all. We do not care about your demographics, your background, or your personal beliefs. These are irrelevant to the function of a pointer or the security of a hash.
    
- **The Agenda is the Code:** We explicitly welcome contributors with diverse **technical agendas** (academic research, niche business cases, edge deployments). Diverse motivations create a robust system. Political agendas, however, are rejected.
    
- **No Soapboxes:** While we are indifferent to your identity, we are hostile to the _politicization_ of that identity within this project. Do not use issues, commit messages, or documentation to signal virtue or advance a social agenda.
    

## 3\. STATE AS PROTOCOL

If this project adheres to any philosophy, it is the **State as Protocol**.

- **Mechanism over Policy:** We build mechanisms that allow users to define their own policies. We do not bake moral choices into the compiler.
    
- **Governance is Minimal:** Automated where possible, and strictly functional.
    
- **Sovereignty:** Authority in this project stems from competence and the ability to maintain the protocol's integrity, not from social consensus.
    

## 4\. COMMUNICATION STANDARDS

We value clarity and technical truth over comfort. We emulate the high standards of the Linux kernel without the performative brutality.

- **Be Direct, Not Toxic:** Technical criticism is not a personal attack. If your code is described as "insecure" or "garbage," understand this refers to the _bytes_, not your _being_. Fix the bytes.
    
- **Thick Skin Required:** Direct, blunt, and constructive feedback is the norm. We do not sugarcoat. We expect you to defend your technical decisions with logic and data, not emotion.
    
- **No Bikeshedding:** Do not waste entropy discussing trivialities. Focus on the architecture, the security model, and the implementation.
    

## 5\. THE OPEN FORGE DOCTRINE

We avoid the "SQLite Trap" (Open Source but Closed Contribution). We are building a "Blank Canvas" for innovation, not a legacy artifact.

- **The Documentation Mandate:** Architecture must be documented clearly (e.g., `compat.md`, `roadmap.md`) to lower the barrier for high-quality contributions. Obscurity is security through obscurity, which is false security.
    
- **The Disjoint Set:** We do not wait for 100% parity with legacy systems to release. We define our own value proposition. If a feature is distinct and valuable, it belongs.
    
- **Self-Sustaining Ecosystem:** We optimize for a community where contributors derive direct value (jobs, research, product stability) from their contributions.
    

## 6\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

In the event of a conflict:

1. Refer to the Code (and the Simulation Results).
    
2. Refer to the Architecture.
    
3. If the conflict persists, the Maintainer's decision is final—not as a ruler, but as the primary key holder of the project's integrity.
