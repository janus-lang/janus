# The Libertaria Commonwealth License (LCL-1.0)

### ⚡ Developer Summary (TL;DR)

**This software belongs to the tribe.** It is free to use, modify, and distribute, but you cannot privatize it.

We enforce **Total Reciprocity**:

1. **No Secrets:** If you modify this code, you must share your changes.
    
2. **No "Cloud" Loophole:** If you run this software as a Service (SaaS) or backend API, you **must** offer the source code to your users. Hiding behind a server does not exempt you.
    
3. **Virality:** You cannot link this code into a closed-source application. If you mix your code with ours, your code becomes Commonwealth too.
    

Code for the common good, or not at all.

### 🛡️ Why LCL-1.0?

- **Anti-Monopoly:** Prevents "Strip-Mining"—where corporations take open code, wrap it in a paid cloud service, and contribute nothing back.
    
- **SaaS-Proof:** Closes the gap left by older licenses (like GPL) that didn't foresee the Cloud era.
    
- **Patent Disarmament:** Includes a "Cold War" clause. If you sue for patents, you lose your license.
    
- **Fortified:** Governed by **Dutch Law** (Amsterdam) to ensure the Commonwealth is protected by unshakeable legal certainty.
