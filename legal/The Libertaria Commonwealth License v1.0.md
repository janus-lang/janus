The Libertaria Commonwealth License (LCL) v1.0

Preamble
This License is an instrument of total transparency. It ensures that software remains a common good, regardless of how it is distributed or accessed. It closes the "Service Loophole," guaranteeing that users of networked services have the same rights to the code as users of binary files.

1. Definitions
"The Work" means the source code, documentation, and other artistic works contained in this distribution.

"Contributor" means the Licensor and any entity submitting content to the Work.

"Derivative Work" means any work that is based on the Work, links to the Work, or incorporates the Work into a larger program.

"Network Deployment" means the use of the Work or a Derivative Work to provide a service to users over a computer network (e.g., as a SaaS, API, or web application), regardless of whether the software itself is distributed to those users.

2. Grant of Rights
2.1. Copyright Grant
Subject to the strict conditions of this License, each Contributor grants You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, sublicense, and distribute the Work.

2.2. Patent Grant
Each Contributor grants You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free patent license to make, use, sell, and transfer the Work. This license terminates automatically if You initiate patent litigation against any entity regarding the Work.

3. Conditions of Use (The "Viral" Nature)
3.1. Copyleft Scope
If You create a Derivative Work (including linking the Work with other libraries or code), the entirety of that Derivative Work must be licensed under this License. You cannot mix this Work with proprietary code and keep the result closed.

3.2. The Service Rule (Closing the SaaS Loophole)
If You perform a Network Deployment of the Work or a Derivative Work, You must make the complete Source Code of that Derivative Work available to all users interacting with it.

Availability: You must provide a prominent download link or repository URL within the user interface or API documentation.

Completeness: This includes all code required to run, build, and deploy the service, excluding only standard system libraries.

3.3. Attribution
You must preserve all copyright notices, license texts, and attribution credits in the Source Code and in the user interface of any Network Deployment.

4. Disclaimer of Warranty
THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE WORK IS WITH YOU.

5. Jurisdiction and Governing Law (Rechtssicherheit)
This License is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of The Netherlands, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to this License or the Work shall be instituted exclusively in the competent courts of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
