The Libertaria Venture License (LVL) v1.0

Preamble
This License is a compact of trust for commercial entities.
It allows the Licensor to distribute the Work in binary-only form, provided that the provenance of the binary is cryptographically verifiable by the Community.
It creates a "Glass Box" model: You may hide the source code, but you cannot hide the build process.

1. Definitions

* "The Work": The binary software, object code, and associated build artifacts distributed under this License.
* "The Binary": The specific package file or executable distributed to end-users.
* "The Provenance": The cryptographic hash tree (Merkle tree), build logs, and digital signatures generated during the compilation of the Work.
* "Trust Registry": The governing body, foundation, or decentralized authority responsible for managing the public keys and identity verification for the project utilizing this License.
* "Registered Entity": An individual or organization currently holding a valid, active status within the Trust Registry, identified by a registered cryptographic key.

2. Grant of Rights
2.1. Commercial Distribution
Subject to the strict conditions of this License, You (the Licensor) may distribute the Work to End Users in Executable Form without releasing the Source Code.
2.2. End User Rights
The End User receives a non-exclusive, perpetual license to run, install, and use the Work for its intended purpose. The End User may not reverse engineer or decompile the Work, except as permitted by applicable law for interoperability.

3. Conditions of Trust (The "Glass Box" Rule)
3.1. Verified Identity
You must sign the Work with a cryptographic key that corresponds to a valid Registered Entity status on the project's Trust Registry.
3.2. Cryptographic Provenance
Even though the Source Code is closed, You must include the Build Manifest in the distribution.

* Requirement: The manifest must prove that the Binary matches the declared version specifications and was built in a clean environment.
* Auditability: You agree that if a compliance audit by the Trust Registry reveals that the distributed Binary contains malicious code not accounted for in the declared dependencies, your Registered Entity status and this License are immediately revoked.

4. Patent Grant (The "Cold War" Clause)
You grant the End User a patent license to use the Work. This license terminates automatically if the End User initiates patent litigation against You regarding the Work.

5. Disclaimer & Liability
THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE WORK.

6. Jurisdiction (Rechtssicherheit)
This License is governed by the laws of The Netherlands. Any disputes shall be instituted exclusively in the competent courts of Amsterdam.
